<!-- My research focuses on computer vision and its applications to healthcare with current projects in understanding the progression of age-related macular degeneration and improving data representations. I previously worked on landmark detection for hip displacement surveillance and analyzed disparities in pediatric emergencies. As an undergraduate, I studied renal aquaporin trafficking through a cell biology lens. -->
