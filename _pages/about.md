I'm a 3rd year MD-PhD (1st year PhD) student in CSE at the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. [Stella Yu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/). 

My research focuses on computer vision and its applications to healthcare. Current projects include topics in hierarchical clustering, detecting landmarks on hip radiographs, and improving 2D and 3D cell segmentation. As an undergraduate, I worked in cell biology on renal aquaporin trafficking, and earlier in medical school, I studied racial disparities in pediatric emergencies.
