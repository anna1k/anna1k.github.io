My research focuses on computer vision and its applications to healthcare with current projects in hierarchical classification and forecasting. I previously worked on hip landmark detection and analyzed disparities in pediatric emergencies. As an undergraduate, I studied renal aquaporin trafficking from a cell biology lens.
